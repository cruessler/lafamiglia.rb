# La Famiglia

La Famiglia is a multiplayer browser game focusing on:

- simple game play,
- easily usable UI,
- diplomacy and the interaction between players.

Every player starts with a villa where they can construct buildings and recruit
units. As soon as they have units they can attack other players, plunder their
resources, and eventually conquer their villas.

The game itself is designed to be rather simple, making diplomacy the most
important and interesting part of it.

This version is developed using Ruby on Rails. It predates a second version
written using Elixir and Phoenix which can be found at

## Status

Development has shifted to the Elixir version.
